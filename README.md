## Love Food App

A full stack web application that allows the user to browse within the Spoonacular recipe database, search for recipes based on a random search and filter recipes by diet and meal type.

Each recipe links to a recipe card with a list of ingredients and instructions and can be saved (and deleted) from the favourites.

The app includes an option to create an account, login and logout.
